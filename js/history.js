    origins: "November 2008, the Airship Victoria is born; part mobile art installation, part science experiment.  The dirigible's original concept sketches convey the scale of the project and of the steampunk styling.\n \nOver the course of the following months, several small-scale tests were performed to see likely behaviors of different shapes.",
    x1: "Ten months after starting work on the first prototype, the X1, is unveiled at Burning Man in August 2009.  This design consisted fo four, ten ft. diameter helium cells.  The goal was to test construction and design techniques fo a large-scale, lighter than air structure at Burning Man.",
    x2: "In October 2009, lessons learned from Burning Man were applied to the design in time for Decompression SF.  This version became the X2.  Lighting effects were projected from the ground and controls included a laptop and keyboard which controlled the singing Tesla coil.",
    x25: "By the summer of 2010 the prototype was completed for the X2.5, which was designed to fly.  The major changes to eliminate weight included an entirely new frame and balloon retention bands made by hand.\n \nA fully integrated flight control panel was designed, built and mounted in the anchor vehicle.  This included a new self leveling system to ensure in-flight stability.\n \nAn airborne lgihting system was incorporated into the airframe to add dramatic effects while in flight.  The music system was upgraded to support a MIDI keyboard.",
    x3: "The X3 took a step forward in the design of the frame and the size by incorporating seven 15 foot wide balloons in addition to the six 10 foot balloons on top.  This also successfully flew, though without a functional mounted Tesla coil, there was a ground coil that was used for audio.",
    x4beyond: "The X4 moves into an entirely different direction and is the most ambitious project overall.  A singlular balloon will replace the multicellular designs of the past, and will be moble again with three vehicles with mounted audio systems that will be Tesla coil plasma speaker clusters."
